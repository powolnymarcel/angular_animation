<h2>Notes:</h2>

Let’s take a look at how ngAnimate works. ngAnimate will add and remove CSS classes to different Angular directives based on if they are entering or leaving the view. For example, when we load up a site, whatever is populated in ng-view gets a .ng-enter class.

All we have to do is apply a CSS animation to that .ng-enter class and that will be applied upon entry.

ngAnimate Works On: ngRepeat, ngInclude, ngIf, ngSwitch, ngShow, ngHide, ngView, and ngClass

Definitely go through the ngAnimate documentation to see more of what ngAnimate can do. Now let’s see it in action.
